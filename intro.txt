Tradictional Infra: 
    connect to console and manage it
    manually

IaC:
    API driven
    higher elasticity of resources
    higher scaler
    cyclic: scale down at night, scale up during the day
    put it into revision

Terraform:
    IaC
    for on-premise and cloud
    human readable format
    versionable
    consistent workflow to provision and manage infra in its lifecycle
    API based using a Terraform Provider -> Terraform Registry

Stages:
    Write: Define resources
    Plan: Create the execution plan -> infra to be created / updated / destroyed based on currect infra and config
        : Desired + State = Plan
    Apply: Approval granted, execute the plan, in the correct order respecting dependencies

Mutable Infrastructure Approach:
    -) No upgrades
    -) No states in between
    -) Just create a brand new resource(s) and point to it
    -) Decommission old resource can be done afterwards

landing zone setup -> Initial Deploy

Policy: 
    -) Costs
    -) Sec
    -) Compliance
    -) Ops

Modules

Registry (how to use module)
    -) MySQL Pattern

MySQL -> Lifecycle

Module Lifecycle management

PinOps (control who changes Terraform configuration)

Packer: Terraform predefined configuration
